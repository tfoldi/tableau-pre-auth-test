## Test with `curl`

Everything is fine, we can see the Basic auth headers (tablea/tableau)

```curl --verbose http://tableau:tableau@localhost:3000/evaluate/ -d '{script:""}'
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 3000 (#0)
* Server auth using Basic with user 'tableau'

# From Tableau prep 2020.1 Beta

These are the headers after setting nossl + basic auth:

```
{"host":"localhost:3000","authorization":"Basic dGFibGVhdTp0YWJsZWF1","user-agent":"curl/7.54.0","accept":"*/*","content-length":"11","content-type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}

```


In case of TabPy:

```
  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized..Server: TornadoServer/6.0.3..Content-Type: application/json..Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2020 23:53:24 GMT..Www-Authenticate: Basic realm="TabPy Server"..Content-Length: 77..Vary: Ac
